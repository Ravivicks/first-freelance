                      support team via email, phone, or through your customer
                      portal to start the return or exchange process. Please

                      will issue a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA)
                      number, which you will need to include with the returned
                      product. This ensures that your return is processed
                      quickly and accurately.

                      Package the Product: Ensure that the product is securely
                      packaged, using the original packaging if possible, to
                      avoid any damage during return shipping. For items like
                      PLCs, HMIs, or other sensitive components, we recommend
                      using protective packaging to ensure the product arrives

                      return shipping, making the process even more convenient.

                      process your refund, replacement, or exchange. Refunds are
